# Java Language Codes Repository

Welcome to my Java practice playground! This repository contains code snippets, exercises, and small projects I've created while learning Java. 

---
As a Java enthusiast, (and also it's my family name :laughing: ) I use this space to:
- Practice core Java concepts
- Solve coding challenges
- Experiment with new Java features
- Store academic assignments
- Document my coding journey

###  Important Disclaimers!
1. **Educational Purpose**  
   Most code here comes from:
   - Personal learning exercises
   - University/school assignments
   - Online course practice problems
   - and needless to say, A.I :sweat_smile:
   
2. **Not Production-Ready**  
   ```diff
   - These are practice implementations -
   + Not optimized or enterprise-grade solutions +
3.  **Hobby Project**
    
    > "Programming isn't about typing, it's about thinking."  
    > â€• Rich Hickey
    
    This is purely a passion project maintained during my free time.
    
4.  **Varied Quality**  
    Expect inconsistent:
    
    -   Coding styles
        
    -   Documentation levels
        
    -   Implementation approaches  
        _(I'm experimenting as I learn! please don't judge me, though I accept constructive critisism :innocent:)_
