As a Java enthusiast, (and also it's my family name :laughing: ) I use this space to:
- Practice core Java concepts
- Solve coding challenges
- Experiment with new Java features
- Store academic assignments
- Document my coding journey

###  Important Disclaimers!
1. **Educational Purpose**  
   Most code here comes from:
   - Personal learning exercises
   - University/school assignments
   - Online course practice problems
   - and needless to say, A.I :sweat_smile:
   
2. **Not Production-Ready**  
   ```diff
