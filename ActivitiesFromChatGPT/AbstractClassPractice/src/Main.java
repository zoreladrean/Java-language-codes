// Activity 7: Abstract Classes

// In Main:

// Loop through the Person[] array again.

// Call both introduce() and getRole() for each person.

// ðŸ”Ž Example of what the output might look like:

// Hi, my name is Person's name and I am 30 years old.
// Role: Person

// Hi, my name is Student's name and I am 18 years old, and I am in grade 5.
// Role: Student

// Hi, my name is Teacher's name, I am 30 years old, and I teach Programming.
// Role: Teacher


// Would you like me to give you a starter skeleton for the abstract version of Person, or do you want to try setting it up yourself first?
